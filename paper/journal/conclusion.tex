\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

In complex web application attackers find various ways to inject
malicious content in a website. Content Security Policy (CSP) provides
a content restriction mechanism to allow website administrators to
client side control of the types of content that can be loaded and the
sources they can be loaded from. It also provides the ability for web
browsers to distinguish web site intended contents and injected
content.  In this work, we present an approach, UserCSP, that helps
web administrators and users write compressive CSP rules for
websites. It also automatically infers CSP rules for websites. Our
prototype was implemented in the Firefox extension using the JetPack
SDK.
