                  variables. This work models the attribute length,
                  character distribution, and presence or absence of
                  attributes for each session variable. Also, the work
                  identifies some invariants for combinations of
                  session variables. The PHP intrepreter is
                  instrumented to detect anomalies in session
                  variables during execution. The anamoly detection
                  has a significant overhead. There is a learning
                  phase during which the system is trained on good
                  traffic to create these models. Then, there is a
                  detection phase during which anamolies in the
                  session variables are detected. However, the paper
                  is silent on how to create good traffic. }
