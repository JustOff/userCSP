\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We implemented our approach in the Firefox v14.0 using JetPack SDK
v1.9 and manually tested our approach against manual as well as
automatically inferred CSP policies. We used Alexa Top 10
Sites\footnote[2]{Alexa top 10 sites used for evaluation were:
  facebook.com, google.co.in, youtube.com, yahoo.com, baidu.com,
  wikipedia.org, live.com, twitter.com, qq.com, and amazon.com} to
test our approach against user defined CSP policies as well as
automatically inferred CSP policies. Automatically inferred CSP
policies doesn't break the website whereas manually defined CSP
policies required several rounds of refinement and web page source
code inspection to record content sources. The reason for that is
initially we set CSP policy for a website to load resources from its
own domain only whereas web sites were loading the contents CDN's or
sub-domains.  Appendix~\ref{appendix} shows examples of inferred CSP
policies.
