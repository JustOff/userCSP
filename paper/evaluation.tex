\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We implemented our approach in Firefox v14.0 using JetPack SDK
v1.9. We used Alexa Top 10 Sites \footnote[2]{Alexa top 10 sites used
  for evaluation were: facebook.com, google.co.in, youtube.com,
  yahoo.com, baidu.com, wikipedia.org, live.com, twitter.com, qq.com,
  and amazon.com} to test our approach against user defined CSP
policies as well as automatically inferred CSP policies. Automatically
inferred CSP policies don¡¯t break websites whereas manually defined
CSP policies required several rounds of refinement and web page source
code inspection to record content sources. The reason for that is
initially we set CSP rules for a website to load resources from its
own domain only, but websites were loading content from CDN¡¯s or
sub-domains. Appendix~\ref{appendix} shows examples of inferred CSP
policies.
