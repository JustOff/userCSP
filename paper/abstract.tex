According to OWASP top vulnerability list, cross-site scripting (XSS)
is among the top five web application vulnerabilities. It allows
attackers to inject malicious code or resources from attacker domains
into the document of the vulnerable web page. Browsers are not able to
distinguish which content is legitimate and which content is
malicious. Therefore, Content Security Policy is used to enable the
browser to identify potentially malicious injected content in a web
page.

By-default CSP doesn't allow inline scripts and eval, which are used
by almost all website. Therefore to use CSP policy, websites requires
to change their code. The requirement of this change is hindering the
adaptation of CSP by web applications (websites). However, there are
savvy users who prefer security over usability. In addition, web sites
developers need a tool to test different CSP rules for their website
to secure their users and achieve usability. To address these issues
we proposed an approach \codename and prototype our approach in
Firefox extension using the JetPack framework.  \codename allows savvy
users to specify CSP to particular websites or to specify general CSP
rules that is enforced on each and every website a user
visits. Moreover, it allows website developers to try different CSP
rules to adapt the best suited CSP policy for their website.
