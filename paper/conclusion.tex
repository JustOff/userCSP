\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

In complex web application attackers find various ways to inject
malicious content in a website. Content Security Policy (CSP) provides
content restrictions mechanism to allow web site administrators to
control at client side, what types of content can be loaded and from
what sources it can be loaded. It also provides ability to web
browsers to distinguish web site intended contents and injected
content. In this work, we present an approach, \codename, that helps
web administrators as well as users to write compressive CSP policy
for a website. It also automatically infer CSP policy for a
website. Our prototype was implemented in the Firefox extension using
the JetPack SDK.
