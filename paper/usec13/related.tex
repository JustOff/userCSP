Content Security Policy(CSP)~\cite{csp} provides content restriction
enforcement that allows web sites to specify which sites are trusted
and then rely on the userâ€™s browser to forbid loading resources from
untrusted sites or from the sites not in the list specified by the web
application.  We extended CSP mechanism to allow users to specify CSP
policy for a web site, and then enforce it. 

BEAP~\cite{beap} mitigates the CSRF attack at client side. It infers
whether a request reflects user's intention using the heuristics
derived from analyzing real-world web applications. If a sensitive
request does not reflects users' intention, BEAP strips authentication
token from it. Whereas CSP blocks all requests except for those that
the web site has explicitly granted.  

Browser-enforce Embedded Policies (BEEP)~\cite{beep} aims to allow web
applications to specify which scripts can run on its web site. As
compared to our approach, BEEP is limited to restricting scripts that
can run on a web site, whereas other contents such as images, frames,
style sheets, etc are not restricted.
