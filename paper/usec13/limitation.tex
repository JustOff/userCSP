\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limit}

The current implementation of userCSP add-on does not completely
follow the W3C CSP 1.0 standard, but complies with Firefox's current
implementation. Therefore, we used 'X-Content-Security-Policy' header,
whereas according to W3C CSP 1.0 standard uses the
'Content-Security-Policy' header. Firefox is in process to support CSP
1.0 standard.

Another limitation of Firefox's current implementation and hence this
add-on is the use of the 'Options' CSP directive to allow or disallow
inline scripts and inline evals. Whereas in CSP 1.0, inline JavaScript
and evals are set in 'script-src' directive and inline css is set in
the 'style-src' directive.
